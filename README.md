Why Python?

Why "Learn Python the Hard Way"?

* As I have previous programming experience, I wanted to quickly get a grasp of the 
basics of Python.
* This book emphasizes attention to detail and the persistence to type every single 
character, as opposed to copy/paste.

What is it?
The book has 52 exercises covering: 
* user and file input, output, variables, functions, boolean algebra,
 conditional statements, objects and classes.
 

Other practice:
I intend to quickly expand into NumPy/SciPy and matplotlib. My next project will be:
The Game of Life.
